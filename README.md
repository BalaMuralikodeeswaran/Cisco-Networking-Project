# Cisco Networking Project

## Overview
This project involves designing, implementing, and analyzing a virtual network solution based on a specific scenario. The goal is to meet the networking requirements of a medium-sized company by utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation. The project focuses on networking principles, protocols, devices, and the creation of an efficient and secure networked system.

## Project Requirements
The project was developed to fulfill the following key requirements:

1. **Examine Networking Principles and Protocols**: Discuss the benefits and constraints of various network types, standards, and protocols such as TCP/IP, OSI, IPv4, IPv6, etc.
2. **Explain Networking Devices and Operations**: Explore the operating principles of networking devices like routers, switches, firewalls, and server types, justifying their selection based on the given scenario.
3. **Design Efficient Networked Systems**: Design a network that meets the given specification, including hardware, software, network addresses, and security considerations.
4. **Implement and Diagnose Networked Systems**: Implement the network design in a virtual environment, document test results, and analyze them against expected outcomes.

## Scenario
The project simulates the networking setup for a publishing company that deals with scientific and technical publications. The company operates from two buildings, but due to a shift to a hybrid working model, one building is being closed. The remaining building needs to be reconfigured to support a secure and efficient network that allows employees to work both on-site and remotely.

### Key Requirements:
- **Physical Setup**: 
  - Servers are located in a data center on the top floor.
  - The middle floor contains meeting rooms, the Network Server Room, and network administrators' workstations.
  - The ground floor consists of open-plan 'hot desks' for employees.

- **Remote Work Support**:
  - Employees use company-issued laptops with VPN and firewall configurations.
  - Data is stored on company file servers and accessed via a secure cloud-based model.
  - A high-throughput VPN server is installed for secure remote connectivity.

- **Security**:
  - Strong encryption for data storage and transmission.
  - Robust firewall and backup systems to prevent data breaches and losses.

## Activities
The project is divided into several activities:

1. **Activity 1**: Presentation on Networking Principles and Protocols.
2. **Activity 2**: Design of the Network Solution.
3. **Activity 3**: Implementation of the Virtual Network Solution using Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. **Activity 4**: Evaluation and Reflection on the Network Design and Implementation.

## Project Files
- **Cisco.pkt**: The Packet Tracer file containing the virtual network simulation.
- **Presentation.pdf**: A formal presentation discussing the core principles of networks, protocols, and the selected design.
- **Implementation_Plan.pdf**: A detailed implementation plan covering network design, maintenance schedule, and user feedback analysis.
- **Technical_Report.pdf**: A report documenting the implementation process, test results, and recommendations for potential enhancements.
- **Evaluation_Report.pdf**: A reflective report evaluating the network topology, protocols, and design decisions.

## How to Use

1. **Download the File**: Click on the `Cisco.pkt` file in this repository to download it to your local machine.
2. **Open with Cisco Packet Tracer**: Use Cisco Packet Tracer to open the `Cisco.pkt` file and explore the network design.
3. **Review IP Addresses and Configurations**: Navigate through the network topology to identify IP addresses, device configurations, and other network settings.
4. **Commit Changes**: If any adjustments or enhancements are needed, make the necessary changes within Cisco Packet Tracer, and save the updated file.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of networking principles and best practices in designing and implementing a secure and efficient network system for a real-world scenario. The experience gained from this project is invaluable for understanding the complexities of network design and the importance of careful planning and execution.
